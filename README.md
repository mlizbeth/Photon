# Photon Photo Editor
Group Project for Application Programming. AKA the next Photoshop!

## What's next?
Originally this was just a final project for one of my classes, but I poured a lot of time into it and didn't get to finish. There was so much more I wanted to do but I ran out of time. It was fun and I learned a lot. I still want to see this through so I will be making a new repository and working with one of my friends to finish this project. We will be starting from the ground up and our goal is a free/lightweight competitor to Photoshop. Think layers, alpha, etc.
